# tabata
Simple tabata timer because the apps are annoying and youtube has too many adds.

# How it works
- it will randomly select active music from the active subfolder and rest music from the rest subfolder
- - add or change the mp3 files to customise, no need to change code
 
# Further info
- I have only tested simple variations, e.g., if the block length is in whole minutes, no need that I see to be more specific, not for me anyway.

- # Music
- sample music from https://pixabay.com/music/

- # To run
- from vscode, 'streamlit run app.py' from terminal
